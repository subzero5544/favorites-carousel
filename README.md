Hey everyone! Here's a cool extension I made. A friend gave me the idea, so I decided to give it a go. Basically, it lets you easily scroll through the top favorites bar, either with the arrows on desktop or by swiping on mobile. I hope you all enjoy it. It also has the added benefit of allowing you to have more favorites in the top bar.

some examples of it working

Below are some simple screenshots to show how to install it, just in case you're not familiar with extensions.
